# Privacy Policy
We take your privacy very seriously. Your data is entirely your own, and we donâ€™t make any claims to it. Our commitment is to use your data strictly in accordance with the policies outlined below. If you ever want to remove any stored data, you can do so easily from within the app.

## 1.0 Information We Collect
We only collect some data related to your activities in our app to provide better experience for you. We store them locally on your device and not transmitted outside of your device. There is no gathering of Personally-Identifying Information in our app.

## Photo Library Usage
When you choose to import photos from your device's photo library into Memoji Sticker, they are solely used within the app for generating stickers or related content. Your photos are not saved or transmitted outside of your device. We prioritize the security of your imported photos within the app. You maintain full control over which photos you import, with the ability to revoke access at any time through your device's settings.

## 2.0 Product Links

Inside Memoji Sticker, you will find a link to my personal Twitter/X account. This is just a standard link that will open it on the web or in the app - no embedded third party code. Before clicking the link and visiting Twitter/X, please be aware of their Privacy Policy at first.
